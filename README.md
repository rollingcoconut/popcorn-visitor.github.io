## Exploring the Popcorn Linux ISA-heterogeneous Operating system

[PopcornLinux](http://www.popcornlinux.org/index.php/overview) is a developing Operating System that can run transparently over a heterogeneous set of kernels (x68/arm)  on heterogeneous machines. The different kernels communicate entirely through message passing. 

We wanted to take this developing Operating System for a test-drive and get a feel for message latency first hand. Here we document the the additional steps we needed to follow along with the tutorial, as well as the experiment we performed once we got things running.
